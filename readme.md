# Isometric map

I've built this simple app to understand how to create isometric maps.
It uses simple divs instead of a canvas element.

Feel free to modify it.

# Files

* mapEngine.js: this contains the methods to draw the map to the screen.
* astar.js: the A* pathfinder algorithm.
* gameEngine.js: handling the mouse event, moving the guy on the screen, adding new tiles to the map, etc.
* selector.js: like a mini jQuery to do some basic DOM manipulation.
* overlay.js: the white overlay box. You see it on the top-left.

# The Math behind isometric projection

The only page you need to read. It explains the topic very well and it is easy to follow.
